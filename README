## Assumption
This project assumes the following are true:

1.  The currency is fixed to USD. To support other currencies, an utility class is desired to handle the currency display from its smallest unit.
2.  For simplicity, this project does not include customer membership management, order management, and other commonly seen features provided in e-commerce software. This means you can pay for the same item many times.

  

## Certificate Issues

This project uses a self-signed certificate and it is not trusted by the Chrome browser by default.

You must **manually trust the self-signed certificate** first before you can try the payment flow. See https://www.pico.net/kb/how-do-you-get-chrome-to-accept-a-self-signed-certificate/ for the details.
